# Agent Skills

> Agent Skills are modular capabilities that extend Claude's functionality. Each Skill packages instructions, metadata, and optional resources (scripts, templates) that Claude uses automatically when relevant.

## Why use Skills

Skills are reusable, filesystem-based resources that provide Claude with domain-specific expertise: workflows, context, and best practices that transform general-purpose agents into specialists. Unlike prompts (conversation-level instructions for one-off tasks), Skills load on-demand and eliminate the need to repeatedly provide the same guidance across multiple conversations.

**Key benefits**:

* **Specialize Claude**: Tailor capabilities for domain-specific tasks
* **Reduce repetition**: Create once, use automatically
* **Compose capabilities**: Combine Skills to build complex workflows

<Note>
  For a deep dive into the architecture and real-world applications of Agent Skills, read our engineering blog: [Equipping agents for the real world with Agent Skills](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/equipping-agents-for-the-real-world-with-agent-skills).
</Note>

## Using Skills

Anthropic provides pre-built Agent Skills for common document tasks (PowerPoint, Excel, Word, PDF), and you can create your own custom Skills. Both work the same way. Claude automatically uses them when relevant to your request.

**Pre-built Agent Skills** are available to all users on claude.ai and via the Claude API. See the [Available Skills](#available-skills) section below for the complete list.

**Custom Skills** let you package domain expertise and organizational knowledge. They're available across Claude's products: create them in Claude Code, upload them via the API, or add them in claude.ai settings.

<Note>
  **Get started:**

  * For pre-built Agent Skills: See the [quickstart tutorial](/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/quickstart) to start using PowerPoint, Excel, Word, and PDF skills in the API
  * For custom Skills: See the [Agent Skills Cookbook](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-cookbooks/tree/main/skills) to learn how to create your own Skills
</Note>

## How Skills work

Skills leverage Claude's VM environment to provide capabilities beyond what's possible with prompts alone. Claude operates in a virtual machine with filesystem access, allowing Skills to exist as directories containing instructions, executable code, and reference materials, organized like an onboarding guide you'd create for a new team member.

This filesystem-based architecture enables **progressive disclosure**: Claude loads information in stages as needed, rather than consuming context upfront.

### Three types of Skill content, three levels of loading

Skills can contain three types of content, each loaded at different times:

### Level 1: Metadata (always loaded)

**Content type: Instructions**. The Skill's YAML frontmatter provides discovery information:

```yaml  theme={null}
---
name: pdf-processing
description: Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill forms, merge documents. Use when working with PDF files or when the user mentions PDFs, forms, or document extraction.
---
```

Claude loads this metadata at startup and includes it in the system prompt. This lightweight approach means you can install many Skills without context penalty; Claude only knows each Skill exists and when to use it.

### Level 2: Instructions (loaded when triggered)

**Content type: Instructions**. The main body of SKILL.md contains procedural knowledge: workflows, best practices, and guidance:

````markdown  theme={null}
# PDF Processing

## Quick start

Use pdfplumber to extract text from PDFs:

```python
import pdfplumber

with pdfplumber.open("document.pdf") as pdf:
    text = pdf.pages[0].extract_text()
```

For advanced form filling, see [FORMS.md](FORMS.md).
````

When you request something that matches a Skill's description, Claude reads SKILL.md from the filesystem via bash. Only then does this content enter the context window.

### Level 3: Resources and code (loaded as needed)

**Content types: Instructions, code, and resources**. Skills can bundle additional materials:

```
pdf-skill/
├── SKILL.md (main instructions)
├── FORMS.md (form-filling guide)
├── REFERENCE.md (detailed API reference)
└── scripts/
    └── fill_form.py (utility script)
```

**Instructions**: Additional markdown files (FORMS.md, REFERENCE.md) containing specialized guidance and workflows

**Code**: Executable scripts (fill\_form.py, validate.py) that Claude runs via bash; scripts provide deterministic operations without consuming context

**Resources**: Reference materials like database schemas, API documentation, templates, or examples

Claude accesses these files only when referenced. The filesystem model means each content type has different strengths: instructions for flexible guidance, code for reliability, resources for factual lookup.

| Level                     | When Loaded             | Token Cost             | Content                                                               |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Level 1: Metadata**     | Always (at startup)     | \~100 tokens per Skill | `name` and `description` from YAML frontmatter                        |
| **Level 2: Instructions** | When Skill is triggered | Under 5k tokens        | SKILL.md body with instructions and guidance                          |
| **Level 3+: Resources**   | As needed               | Effectively unlimited  | Bundled files executed via bash without loading contents into context |

Progressive disclosure ensures only relevant content occupies the context window at any given time.

### The Skills architecture

Skills run in a code execution environment where Claude has filesystem access, bash commands, and code execution capabilities. Think of it like this: Skills exist as directories on a virtual machine, and Claude interacts with them using the same bash commands you'd use to navigate files on your computer.

**How Claude accesses Skill content:**

When a Skill is triggered, Claude uses bash to read SKILL.md from the filesystem, bringing its instructions into the context window. If those instructions reference other files (like FORMS.md or a database schema), Claude reads those files too using additional bash commands. When instructions mention executable scripts, Claude runs them via bash and receives only the output (the script code itself never enters context).

**What this architecture enables:**

**On-demand file access**: Claude reads only the files needed for each specific task. A Skill can include dozens of reference files, but if your task only needs the sales schema, Claude loads just that one file. The rest remain on the filesystem consuming zero tokens.

**Efficient script execution**: When Claude runs `validate_form.py`, the script's code never loads into the context window. Only the script's output (like "Validation passed" or specific error messages) consumes tokens. This makes scripts far more efficient than having Claude generate equivalent code on the fly.

**No practical limit on bundled content**: Because files don't consume context until accessed, Skills can include comprehensive API documentation, large datasets, extensive examples, or any reference materials you need. There's no context penalty for bundled content that isn't used.

This filesystem-based model is what makes progressive disclosure work. Claude navigates your Skill like you'd reference specific sections of an onboarding guide, accessing exactly what each task requires.

### Example: Loading a PDF processing skill

Here's how Claude loads and uses a PDF processing skill:

1. **Startup**: System prompt includes: `PDF Processing - Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill forms, merge documents`
2. **User request**: "Extract the text from this PDF and summarize it"
3. **Claude invokes**: `bash: read pdf-skill/SKILL.md` → Instructions loaded into context
4. **Claude determines**: Form filling is not needed, so FORMS.md is not read
5. **Claude executes**: Uses instructions from SKILL.md to complete the task

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/anthropic-claude-docs/4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00/images/agent-skills-context-window.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00&q=85&s=0127e014bfc3dd3c86567aad8609111b" alt="Skills loading into context window - showing the progressive loading of skill metadata and content" data-og-width="2048" width="2048" data-og-height="1154" height="1154" data-path="images/agent-skills-context-window.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/anthropic-claude-docs/4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00/images/agent-skills-context-window.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00&q=85&s=a17315d47b7c5a85b389026b70676e98 280w, https://mintcdn.com/anthropic-claude-docs/4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00/images/agent-skills-context-window.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00&q=85&s=267349b063954588d4fae2650cb90cd8 560w, https://mintcdn.com/anthropic-claude-docs/4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00/images/agent-skills-context-window.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00&q=85&s=0864972aba7bcb10bad86caf82cb415f 840w, https://mintcdn.com/anthropic-claude-docs/4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00/images/agent-skills-context-window.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00&q=85&s=631d661cbadcbdb62fd0935b91bd09f8 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/anthropic-claude-docs/4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00/images/agent-skills-context-window.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00&q=85&s=c1f80d0e37c517eb335db83615483ae0 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/anthropic-claude-docs/4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00/images/agent-skills-context-window.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00&q=85&s=4b6d0f1baf011ff9b49de501d8d83cc7 2500w" />

The diagram shows:

1. Default state with system prompt and skill metadata pre-loaded
2. Claude triggers the skill by reading SKILL.md via bash
3. Claude optionally reads additional bundled files like FORMS.md as needed
4. Claude proceeds with the task

This dynamic loading ensures only relevant skill content occupies the context window.

## Where Skills work

Skills are available across Claude's agent products:

### Claude API

The Claude API supports both pre-built Agent Skills and custom Skills. Both work identically: specify the relevant `skill_id` in the `container` parameter along with the code execution tool.

**Prerequisites**: Using Skills via the API requires three beta headers:

* `code-execution-2025-08-25` - Skills run in the code execution container
* `skills-2025-10-02` - Enables Skills functionality
* `files-api-2025-04-14` - Required for uploading/downloading files to/from the container

Use pre-built Agent Skills by referencing their `skill_id` (e.g., `pptx`, `xlsx`), or create and upload your own via the Skills API (`/v1/skills` endpoints). Custom Skills are shared organization-wide.

To learn more, see [Use Skills with the Claude API](/en/docs/build-with-claude/skills-guide).

### Claude Code

[Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview) supports only Custom Skills.

**Custom Skills**: Create Skills as directories with SKILL.md files. Claude discovers and uses them automatically.

Custom Skills in Claude Code are filesystem-based and don't require API uploads.

To learn more, see [Use Skills in Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills).

### Claude Agent SDK

The [Claude Agent SDK](/en/docs/agent-sdk/overview) supports custom Skills through filesystem-based configuration.

**Custom Skills**: Create Skills as directories with SKILL.md files in `.claude/skills/`. Enable Skills by including `"Skill"` in your `allowed_tools` configuration.

Skills in the Agent SDK are then automatically discovered when the SDK runs.

To learn more, see [Agent Skills in the SDK](/en/docs/agent-sdk/skills).

### Claude.ai

[Claude.ai](https://claude.ai) supports both pre-built Agent Skills and custom Skills.

**Pre-built Agent Skills**: These Skills are already working behind the scenes when you create documents. Claude uses them without requiring any setup.

**Custom Skills**: Upload your own Skills as zip files through Settings > Features. Available on Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise plans with code execution enabled. Custom Skills are individual to each user; they are not shared organization-wide and cannot be centrally managed by admins.

To learn more about using Skills in Claude.ai, see the following resources in the Claude Help Center:

* [What are Skills?](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12512176-what-are-skills)
* [Using Skills in Claude](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12512180-using-skills-in-claude)
* [How to create custom Skills](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12512198-creating-custom-skills)
* [Teach Claude your way of working using Skills](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12580051-teach-claude-your-way-of-working-using-skills)

## Skill structure

Every Skill requires a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml  theme={null}
---
name: your-skill-name
description: Brief description of what this Skill does and when to use it
---

# Your Skill Name

## Instructions
[Clear, step-by-step guidance for Claude to follow]

## Examples
[Concrete examples of using this Skill]
```

**Required fields**: `name` and `description`

**Field requirements**:

`name`:

* Maximum 64 characters
* Must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens
* Cannot contain XML tags
* Cannot contain reserved words: "anthropic", "claude"

`description`:

* Must be non-empty
* Maximum 1024 characters
* Cannot contain XML tags

The `description` should include both what the Skill does and when Claude should use it. For complete authoring guidance, see the [best practices guide](/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices).

## Security considerations

We strongly recommend using Skills only from trusted sources: those you created yourself or obtained from Anthropic. Skills provide Claude with new capabilities through instructions and code, and while this makes them powerful, it also means a malicious Skill can direct Claude to invoke tools or execute code in ways that don't match the Skill's stated purpose.

<Warning>
  If you must use a Skill from an untrusted or unknown source, exercise extreme caution and thoroughly audit it before use. Depending on what access Claude has when executing the Skill, malicious Skills could lead to data exfiltration, unauthorized system access, or other security risks.
</Warning>

**Key security considerations**:

* **Audit thoroughly**: Review all files bundled in the Skill: SKILL.md, scripts, images, and other resources. Look for unusual patterns like unexpected network calls, file access patterns, or operations that don't match the Skill's stated purpose
* **External sources are risky**: Skills that fetch data from external URLs pose particular risk, as fetched content may contain malicious instructions. Even trustworthy Skills can be compromised if their external dependencies change over time
* **Tool misuse**: Malicious Skills can invoke tools (file operations, bash commands, code execution) in harmful ways
* **Data exposure**: Skills with access to sensitive data could be designed to leak information to external systems
* **Treat like installing software**: Only use Skills from trusted sources. Be especially careful when integrating Skills into production systems with access to sensitive data or critical operations

## Available Skills

### Pre-built Agent Skills

The following pre-built Agent Skills are available for immediate use:

* **PowerPoint (pptx)**: Create presentations, edit slides, analyze presentation content
* **Excel (xlsx)**: Create spreadsheets, analyze data, generate reports with charts
* **Word (docx)**: Create documents, edit content, format text
* **PDF (pdf)**: Generate formatted PDF documents and reports

These Skills are available on the Claude API and claude.ai. See the [quickstart tutorial](/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/quickstart) to start using them in the API.

### Custom Skills examples

For complete examples of custom Skills, see the [Skills cookbook](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-cookbooks/tree/main/skills).

## Limitations and constraints

Understanding these limitations helps you plan your Skills deployment effectively.

### Cross-surface availability

**Custom Skills do not sync across surfaces**. Skills uploaded to one surface are not automatically available on others:

* Skills uploaded to Claude.ai must be separately uploaded to the API
* Skills uploaded via the API are not available on Claude.ai
* Claude Code Skills are filesystem-based and separate from both Claude.ai and API

You'll need to manage and upload Skills separately for each surface where you want to use them.

### Sharing scope

Skills have different sharing models depending on where you use them:

* **Claude.ai**: Individual user only; each team member must upload separately
* **Claude API**: Workspace-wide; all workspace members can access uploaded Skills
* **Claude Code**: Personal (`~/.claude/skills/`) or project-based (`.claude/skills/`); can also be shared via Claude Code Plugins

Claude.ai does not currently support centralized admin management or org-wide distribution of custom Skills.

### Runtime environment constraints

The exact runtime environment available to your skill depends on the product surface where you use it.

* **Claude.ai**:
  * **Varying network access**: Depending on user/admin settings, Skills may have full, partial, or no network access. For more details, see the [Create and Edit Files](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12111783-create-and-edit-files-with-claude#h_6b7e833898) support article.
* **Claude API**:
  * **No network access**: Skills cannot make external API calls or access the internet
  * **No runtime package installation**: Only pre-installed packages are available. You cannot install new packages during execution.
  * **Pre-configured dependencies only**: Check the [code execution tool documentation](/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool) for the list of available packages
* **Claude Code**:
  * **Full network access**: Skills have the same network access as any other program on the user's computer
  * **Global package installation discouraged**: Skills should only install packages locally in order to avoid interfering with the user's computer

Plan your Skills to work within these constraints.

# Get started with Agent Skills in the API

> Learn how to use Agent Skills to create documents with the Claude API in under 10 minutes.

This tutorial shows you how to use Agent Skills to create a PowerPoint presentation. You'll learn how to enable Skills, make a simple request, and access the generated file.

## Prerequisites

* [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys)
* Python 3.7+ or curl installed
* Basic familiarity with making API requests

## What are Agent Skills?

Pre-built Agent Skills extend Claude's capabilities with specialized expertise for tasks like creating documents, analyzing data, and processing files. Anthropic provides the following pre-built Agent Skills in the API:

* **PowerPoint (pptx)**: Create and edit presentations
* **Excel (xlsx)**: Create and analyze spreadsheets
* **Word (docx)**: Create and edit documents
* **PDF (pdf)**: Generate PDF documents

<Note>
  **Want to create custom Skills?** See the [Agent Skills Cookbook](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-cookbooks/tree/main/skills) for examples of building your own Skills with domain-specific expertise.
</Note>

## Step 1: List available Skills

First, let's see what Skills are available. We'll use the Skills API to list all Anthropic-managed Skills:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python theme={null}
  import anthropic

  client = anthropic.Anthropic()

  # List Anthropic-managed Skills
  skills = client.beta.skills.list(
      source="anthropic",
      betas=["skills-2025-10-02"]
  )

  for skill in skills.data:
      print(f"{skill.id}: {skill.display_title}")
  ```

  ```typescript TypeScript theme={null}
  import Anthropic from '@anthropic-ai/sdk';

  const client = new Anthropic();

  // List Anthropic-managed Skills
  const skills = await client.beta.skills.list({
    source: 'anthropic',
    betas: ['skills-2025-10-02']
  });

  for (const skill of skills.data) {
    console.log(`${skill.id}: ${skill.display_title}`);
  }
  ```

  ```bash Shell theme={null}
  curl "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/skills?source=anthropic" \
    -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
    -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
    -H "anthropic-beta: skills-2025-10-02"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

You see the following Skills: `pptx`, `xlsx`, `docx`, and `pdf`.

This API returns each Skill's metadata: its name and description. Claude loads this metadata at startup to know what Skills are available. This is the first level of **progressive disclosure**, where Claude discovers Skills without loading their full instructions yet.

## Step 2: Create a presentation

Now we'll use the PowerPoint Skill to create a presentation about renewable energy. We specify Skills using the `container` parameter in the Messages API:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python theme={null}
  import anthropic

  client = anthropic.Anthropic()

  # Create a message with the PowerPoint Skill
  response = client.beta.messages.create(
      model="claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
      max_tokens=4096,
      betas=["code-execution-2025-08-25", "skills-2025-10-02"],
      container={
          "skills": [
              {
                  "type": "anthropic",
                  "skill_id": "pptx",
                  "version": "latest"
              }
          ]
      },
      messages=[{
          "role": "user",
          "content": "Create a presentation about renewable energy with 5 slides"
      }],
      tools=[{
          "type": "code_execution_20250825",
          "name": "code_execution"
      }]
  )

  print(response.content)
  ```

  ```typescript TypeScript theme={null}
  import Anthropic from '@anthropic-ai/sdk';

  const client = new Anthropic();

  // Create a message with the PowerPoint Skill
  const response = await client.beta.messages.create({
    model: 'claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929',
    max_tokens: 4096,
    betas: ['code-execution-2025-08-25', 'skills-2025-10-02'],
    container: {
      skills: [
        {
          type: 'anthropic',
          skill_id: 'pptx',
          version: 'latest'
        }
      ]
    },
    messages: [{
      role: 'user',
      content: 'Create a presentation about renewable energy with 5 slides'
    }],
    tools: [{
      type: 'code_execution_20250825',
      name: 'code_execution'
    }]
  });

  console.log(response.content);
  ```

  ```bash Shell theme={null}
  curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
    -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
    -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
    -H "anthropic-beta: code-execution-2025-08-25,skills-2025-10-02" \
    -H "content-type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
      "max_tokens": 4096,
      "container": {

          {
            "type": "anthropic",
            "skill_id": "pptx",

          }
        ]
      },
      "messages": [{
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Create a presentation about renewable energy with 5 slides"
      }],

        "name": "code_execution"
      }]
    }'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Let's break down what each part does:

* **`container.skills`**: Specifies which Skills Claude can use
* **`type: "anthropic"`**: Indicates this is an Anthropic-managed Skill
* **`skill_id: "pptx"`**: The PowerPoint Skill identifier
* **`version: "latest"`**: The Skill version set to the most recently published
* **`tools`**: Enables code execution (required for Skills)
* **Beta headers**: `code-execution-2025-08-25` and `skills-2025-10-02`

When you make this request, Claude automatically matches your task to the relevant Skill. Since you asked for a presentation, Claude determines the PowerPoint Skill is relevant and loads its full instructions: the second level of progressive disclosure. Then Claude executes the Skill's code to create your presentation.

## Step 3: Download the created file

The presentation was created in the code execution container and saved as a file. The response includes a file reference with a file ID. Extract the file ID and download it using the Files API:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python theme={null}
  # Extract file ID from response
  file_id = None
  for block in response.content:
      if block.type == 'tool_use' and block.name == 'code_execution':
          # File ID is in the tool result
          for result_block in block.content:
              if hasattr(result_block, 'file_id'):
                  file_id = result_block.file_id
                  break

  if file_id:
      # Download the file
      file_content = client.beta.files.download(
          file_id=file_id,
          betas=["files-api-2025-04-14"]
      )

      # Save to disk
      with open("renewable_energy.pptx", "wb") as f:
          file_content.write_to_file(f.name)

      print(f"Presentation saved to renewable_energy.pptx")
  ```

  ```typescript TypeScript theme={null}
  // Extract file ID from response
  let fileId: string | null = null;
  for (const block of response.content) {
    if (block.type === 'tool_use' && block.name === 'code_execution') {
      // File ID is in the tool result
      for (const resultBlock of block.content) {
        if ('file_id' in resultBlock) {
          fileId = resultBlock.file_id;
          break;
        }
      }
    }
  }

  if (fileId) {
    // Download the file
    const fileContent = await client.beta.files.download(fileId, {
      betas: ['files-api-2025-04-14']
    });

    // Save to disk
    const fs = require('fs');
    fs.writeFileSync('renewable_energy.pptx', Buffer.from(await fileContent.arrayBuffer()));

    console.log('Presentation saved to renewable_energy.pptx');
  }
  ```

  ```bash Shell theme={null}
  # Extract file_id from response (using jq)
  FILE_ID=$(echo "$RESPONSE" | jq -r '.content[] | select(.type=="tool_use" and .name=="code_execution") | .content[] | select(.file_id) | .file_id')

  # Download the file
  curl "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/files/$FILE_ID/content" \
    -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
    -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
    -H "anthropic-beta: files-api-2025-04-14" \
    --output renewable_energy.pptx

  echo "Presentation saved to renewable_energy.pptx"
  ```

# Using Agent Skills with the API

> Learn how to use Agent Skills to extend Claude's capabilities through the API.

Agent Skills extend Claude's capabilities through organized folders of instructions, scripts, and resources. This guide shows you how to use both pre-built and custom Skills with the Claude API.

<Note>
  For complete API reference including request/response schemas and all parameters, see:

  * [Skill Management API Reference](/en/api/skills/list-skills) - CRUD operations for Skills
  * [Skill Versions API Reference](/en/api/skills/list-skill-versions) - Version management

## Overview

<Note>
  For a deep dive into the architecture and real-world applications of Agent Skills, read our engineering blog: [Equipping agents for the real world with Agent Skills](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/equipping-agents-for-the-real-world-with-agent-skills).
</Note>

Skills integrate with the Messages API through the code execution tool. Whether using pre-built Skills managed by Anthropic or custom Skills you've uploaded, the integration shape is identical—both require code execution and use the same `container` structure.

### Using Skills

Skills integrate identically in the Messages API regardless of source. You specify Skills in the `container` parameter with a `skill_id`, `type`, and optional `version`, and they execute in the code execution environment.

**You can use Skills from two sources:**

| Aspect             | Anthropic Skills                           | Custom Skills                                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Type value**     | `anthropic`                                | `custom`                                                        |
| **Skill IDs**      | Short names: `pptx`, `xlsx`, `docx`, `pdf` | Generated: `skill_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUv`                     |
| **Version format** | Date-based: `20251013` or `latest`         | Epoch timestamp: `1759178010641129` or `latest`                 |
| **Management**     | Pre-built and maintained by Anthropic      | Upload and manage via [Skills API](/en/api/skills/create-skill) |
| **Availability**   | Available to all users                     | Private to your workspace                                       |

Both skill sources are returned by the [List Skills endpoint](/en/api/skills/list-skills) (use the `source` parameter to filter). The integration shape and execution environment are identical—the only difference is where the Skills come from and how they're managed.

### Prerequisites

To use Skills, you need:

1. **Anthropic API key** from the [Console](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys)
2. **Beta headers**:
   * `code-execution-2025-08-25` - Enables code execution (required for Skills)
   * `skills-2025-10-02` - Enables Skills API
   * `files-api-2025-04-14` - For uploading/downloading files to/from container
3. **Code execution tool** enabled in your requests

***

## Using Skills in Messages

### Container Parameter

Skills are specified using the `container` parameter in the Messages API. You can include up to 8 Skills per request.

The structure is identical for both Anthropic and custom Skills—specify the required `type` and `skill_id`, and optionally include `version` to pin to a specific version:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python theme={null}
  import anthropic

  client = anthropic.Anthropic()

  response = client.beta.messages.create(
      model="claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",

                  "version": "latest"
              }
          ]
      },
      messages=[{
          "role": "user",
          "content": "Create a presentation about renewable energy"
      }],
      tools=[{
          "type": "code_execution_20250825",
          "name": "code_execution"
      }]
  )
  ```

  ```typescript TypeScript theme={null}
  import Anthropic from '@anthropic-ai/sdk';

  const client = new Anthropic();

  const response = await client.beta.messages.create({

    max_tokens: 4096,
    betas: ['code-execution-2025-08-25', 'skills-2025-10-02'],
    container: {
      skills: [
        {
          type: 'anthropic',
          skill_id: 'pptx',
          version: 'latest'
        }
      ]
    },
    messages: [{

        "name": "code_execution"
      }]
    }'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Downloading Generated Files

When Skills create documents (Excel, PowerPoint, PDF, Word), they return `file_id` attributes in the response. You must use the Files API to download these files.

**How it works:**

1. Skills create files during code execution
2. Response includes `file_id` for each created file
3. Use Files API to download the actual file content
4. Save locally or process as needed

**Example: Creating and downloading an Excel file**

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python theme={null}
  import anthropic

  client = anthropic.Anthropic()

  # Step 1: Use a Skill to create a file
  response = client.beta.messages.create(
      model="claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
      max_tokens=4096,
      betas=["code-execution-2025-08-25", "skills-2025-10-02"],
      container={
          "skills": [
              {"type": "anthropic", "skill_id": "xlsx", "version": "latest"}
          ]
      },
      messages=[{
          "role": "user",
          "content": "Create an Excel file with a simple budget spreadsheet"
      }],
      tools=[{"type": "code_execution_20250825", "name": "code_execution"}]
  )

  # Step 2: Extract file IDs from the response
  def extract_file_ids(response):
      file_ids = []
      for item in response.content:
          if item.type == 'bash_code_execution_tool_result':
              content_item = item.content
              if content_item.type == 'bash_code_execution_result':
                  for file in content_item.content:
                      if hasattr(file, 'file_id'):
                          file_ids.append(file.file_id)
      return file_ids

  # Step 3: Download the file using Files API
  for file_id in extract_file_ids(response):
      file_metadata = client.beta.files.retrieve_metadata(
          file_id=file_id,
          betas=["files-api-2025-04-14"]
      )
      file_content = client.beta.files.download(
          file_id=file_id,
          betas=["files-api-2025-04-14"]
      )

      # Step 4: Save to disk
      file_content.write_to_file(file_metadata.filename)
      print(f"Downloaded: {file_metadata.filename}")

### Multi-Turn Conversations

Reuse the same container across multiple messages by specifying the container ID:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python theme={null}
  # First request creates container
  response1 = client.beta.messages.create(
      model="claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
      max_tokens=4096,
      betas=["code-execution-2025-08-25", "skills-2025-10-02"],
      container={
          "skills": [
              {"type": "anthropic", "skill_id": "xlsx", "version": "latest"}
          ]
      },
      messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Analyze this sales data"}],
      tools=[{"type": "code_execution_20250825", "name": "code_execution"}]
  )

  # Continue conversation with same container
  messages = [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Analyze this sales data"},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": response1.content},
      {"role": "user", "content": "What was the total revenue?"}
  ]

  response2 = client.beta.messages.create(
      model="claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
      max_tokens=4096,
      betas=["code-execution-2025-08-25", "skills-2025-10-02"],
      container={
          "id": response1.container.id,  # Reuse container
          "skills": [
              {"type": "anthropic", "skill_id": "xlsx", "version": "latest"}
          ]
      },
      messages=messages,
      tools=[{"type": "code_execution_20250825", "name": "code_execution"}]
  )
  ```

  ```typescript TypeScript theme={null}

  const response1 = await client.beta.messages.create({
    model: 'claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929',
    max_tokens: 4096,
    betas: ['code-execution-2025-08-25', 'skills-2025-10-02'],
    container: {
      skills: [

      ]
    },
    messages: [{role: 'user', content: 'Analyze this sales data'}],
    tools: [{type: 'code_execution_20250825', name: 'code_execution'}]
  });

  // Continue conversation with same container
  const messages = [
    {role: 'user', content: 'Analyze this sales data'},
    {role: 'assistant', content: response1.content},
    {role: 'user', content: 'What was the total revenue?'}
  ];

  const response2 = await client.beta.messages.create({
    model: 'claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929',
    max_tokens: 4096,
    betas: ['code-execution-2025-08-25', 'skills-2025-10-02'],
    container: {
      id: response1.container.id,  // Reuse container

    messages,
    tools: [{type: 'code_execution_20250825', name: 'code_execution'}]
  });

### Long-Running Operations

Skills may perform operations that require multiple turns. Handle `pause_turn` stop reasons:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python theme={null}
  messages = [{"role": "user", "content": "Process this large dataset"}]
  max_retries = 10

  response = client.beta.messages.create(
      model="claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
      max_tokens=4096,
      betas=["code-execution-2025-08-25", "skills-2025-10-02"],
      container={
          "skills": [
              {"type": "custom", "skill_id": "skill_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUv", "version": "latest"}
          ]
      },
      messages=messages,
      tools=[{"type": "code_execution_20250825", "name": "code_execution"}]
  )

  # Handle pause_turn for long operations
  for i in range(max_retries):
      if response.stop_reason != "pause_turn":
          break

      messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response.content})
      response = client.beta.messages.create(
          model="claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
          max_tokens=4096,
          betas=["code-execution-2025-08-25", "skills-2025-10-02"],
          container={

                  {"type": "custom", "skill_id": "skill_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUv", "version": "latest"}
              ]
          },
          messages=messages,
          tools=[{"type": "code_execution_20250825", "name": "code_execution"}]
      )
  ```

      ]
    },
    messages,
    tools: [{type: 'code_execution_20250825', name: 'code_execution'}]
  });

  // Handle pause_turn for long operations
  for (let i = 0; i < maxRetries; i++) {
    if (response.stop_reason !== 'pause_turn') {
      break;
    }

    messages.push({role: 'assistant', content: response.content});
    response = await client.beta.messages.create({

  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  The response may include a `pause_turn` stop reason, which indicates that the API paused a long-running Skill operation. You can provide the response back as-is in a subsequent request to let Claude continue its turn, or modify the content if you wish to interrupt the conversation and provide additional guidance.
</Note>

### Using Multiple Skills

Combine multiple Skills in a single request to handle complex workflows:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python theme={null}
  response = client.beta.messages.create(
      model="claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",

                  "type": "anthropic",
                  "skill_id": "xlsx",

## Managing Custom Skills

### Creating a Skill

Upload your custom Skill to make it available in your workspace. You can upload using either a directory path or individual file objects.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python theme={null}
  import anthropic

  client = anthropic.Anthropic()

  # Option 1: Using files_from_dir helper (Python only, recommended)
  from anthropic.lib import files_from_dir

  skill = client.beta.skills.create(
      display_title="Financial Analysis",
      files=files_from_dir("/path/to/financial_analysis_skill"),
      betas=["skills-2025-10-02"]
  )

  # Option 2: Using a zip file
  skill = client.beta.skills.create(
      display_title="Financial Analysis",
      files=[("skill.zip", open("financial_analysis_skill.zip", "rb"))],
      betas=["skills-2025-10-02"]
  )

  # Option 3: Using file tuples (filename, file_content, mime_type)
  skill = client.beta.skills.create(
      display_title="Financial Analysis",
      files=[
          ("financial_skill/SKILL.md", open("financial_skill/SKILL.md", "rb"), "text/markdown"),
          ("financial_skill/analyze.py", open("financial_skill/analyze.py", "rb"), "text/x-python"),
      ],

### Listing Skills

Retrieve all Skills available to your workspace, including both Anthropic pre-built Skills and your custom Skills. Use the `source` parameter to filter by skill type:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python theme={null}
  # List all Skills
  skills = client.beta.skills.list(
      betas=["skills-2025-10-02"]
  )

  for skill in skills.data:
      print(f"{skill.id}: {skill.display_title} (source: {skill.source})")

  # List only custom Skills
  custom_skills = client.beta.skills.list(
      source="custom",
      betas=["skills-2025-10-02"]
  )
  ```

  ```typescript TypeScript theme={null}
  // List all Skills
  const skills = await client.beta.skills.list({
    betas: ['skills-2025-10-02']
  });

  for (const skill of skills.data) {
    console.log(`${skill.id}: ${skill.display_title} (source: ${skill.source})`);
  }

  // List only custom Skills
  const customSkills = await client.beta.skills.list({
    source: 'custom',
    betas: ['skills-2025-10-02']
  });
  ```

  ```bash Shell theme={null}
  # List all Skills
  curl "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/skills" \
    -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
    -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
    -H "anthropic-beta: skills-2025-10-02"

  # List only custom Skills
  curl "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/skills?source=custom" \
    -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
    -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
    -H "anthropic-beta: skills-2025-10-02"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

See the [List Skills API reference](/en/api/skills/list-skills) for pagination and filtering options.

### Retrieving a Skill

Get details about a specific Skill:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python theme={null}
  skill = client.beta.skills.retrieve(
      skill_id="skill_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUv",
      betas=["skills-2025-10-02"]
  )

  print(f"Skill: {skill.display_title}")
  print(f"Latest version: {skill.latest_version}")
  print(f"Created: {skill.created_at}")
  ```

  ```typescript TypeScript theme={null}
  const skill = await client.beta.skills.retrieve(
    'skill_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUv',
    { betas: ['skills-2025-10-02'] }
  );

  console.log(`Skill: ${skill.display_title}`);
  console.log(`Latest version: ${skill.latest_version}`);
  console.log(`Created: ${skill.created_at}`);
  ```

  ```bash Shell theme={null}
  curl "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/skills/skill_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUv" \
    -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
    -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
    -H "anthropic-beta: skills-2025-10-02"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Deleting a Skill

To delete a Skill, you must first delete all its versions:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python theme={null}
  # Step 1: Delete all versions
  versions = client.beta.skills.versions.list(
      skill_id="skill_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUv",
      betas=["skills-2025-10-02"]
  )

  for version in versions.data:
      client.beta.skills.versions.delete(
          skill_id="skill_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUv",
          version=version.version,
          betas=["skills-2025-10-02"]
      )

  # Step 2: Delete the Skill
  client.beta.skills.delete(
      skill_id="skill_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUv",
      betas=["skills-2025-10-02"]
  )
  ```

  ```typescript TypeScript theme={null}
  // Step 1: Delete all versions
  const versions = await client.beta.skills.versions.list(
    'skill_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUv',
    { betas: ['skills-2025-10-02'] }
  );

  for (const version of versions.data) {
    await client.beta.skills.versions.delete(
      'skill_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUv',
      version.version,
      { betas: ['skills-2025-10-02'] }
    );
  }

  // Step 2: Delete the Skill
  await client.beta.skills.delete(
    'skill_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUv',
    { betas: ['skills-2025-10-02'] }
  );
  ```

  ```bash Shell theme={null}
  # Delete all versions first, then delete the Skill
  curl -X DELETE "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/skills/skill_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUv" \
    -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
    -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
    -H "anthropic-beta: skills-2025-10-02"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Attempting to delete a Skill with existing versions will return a 400 error.

### Versioning

Skills support versioning to manage updates safely:

**Anthropic-Managed Skills**:

* Versions use date format: `20251013`
* New versions released as updates are made
* Specify exact versions for stability

**Custom Skills**:

* Auto-generated epoch timestamps: `1759178010641129`
* Use `"latest"` to always get the most recent version
* Create new versions when updating Skill files

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python theme={null}
  # Create a new version
  from anthropic.lib import files_from_dir

  new_version = client.beta.skills.versions.create(
      skill_id="skill_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUv",
      files=files_from_dir("/path/to/updated_skill"),
      betas=["skills-2025-10-02"]
  )

## How Skills Are Loaded

When you specify Skills in a container:

1. **Metadata Discovery**: Claude sees metadata for each Skill (name, description) in the system prompt
2. **File Loading**: Skill files are copied into the container at `/skills/{directory}/`
3. **Automatic Use**: Claude automatically loads and uses Skills when relevant to your request
4. **Composition**: Multiple Skills compose together for complex workflows

The progressive disclosure architecture ensures efficient context usage—Claude only loads full Skill instructions when needed.

***

## Limits and Constraints

### Request Limits

* **Maximum Skills per request**: 8
* **Maximum Skill upload size**: 8MB (all files combined)
* **YAML frontmatter requirements**:
  * `name`: Maximum 64 characters, lowercase letters/numbers/hyphens only, no XML tags, no reserved words
  * `description`: Maximum 1024 characters, non-empty, no XML tags

### Environment Constraints

Skills run in the code execution container with these limitations:

* **No network access** - Cannot make external API calls
* **No runtime package installation** - Only pre-installed packages available
* **Isolated environment** - Each request gets a fresh container

See the [code execution tool documentation](/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool) for available packages.

***

## Best Practices

### When to Use Multiple Skills

Combine Skills when tasks involve multiple document types or domains:

**Good use cases:**

* Data analysis (Excel) + presentation creation (PowerPoint)
* Report generation (Word) + export to PDF
* Custom domain logic + document generation

**Avoid:**

* Including unused Skills (impacts performance)

### Version Management Strategy

**For production:**

```python  theme={null}
# Pin to specific versions for stability
container={
    "skills": [{
        "type": "custom",
        "skill_id": "skill_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUv",
        "version": "1759178010641129"  # Specific version
    }]
}
```

**For development:**

```python  theme={null}
# Use latest for active development
container={
    "skills": [{
        "type": "custom",
        "skill_id": "skill_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUv",
        "version": "latest"  # Always get newest
    }]
}
```

### Prompt Caching Considerations

When using prompt caching, note that changing the Skills list in your container will break the cache:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python theme={null}
  # First request creates cache
  response1 = client.beta.messages.create(
      model="claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
      max_tokens=4096,
      betas=["code-execution-2025-08-25", "skills-2025-10-02", "prompt-caching-2024-07-31"],
      container={
          "skills": [
              {"type": "anthropic", "skill_id": "xlsx", "version": "latest"}
          ]
      },
      messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Analyze sales data"}],
      tools=[{"type": "code_execution_20250825", "name": "code_execution"}]
  )

  # Adding/removing Skills breaks cache
  response2 = client.beta.messages.create(
      model="claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
      max_tokens=4096,
      betas=["code-execution-2025-08-25", "skills-2025-10-02", "prompt-caching-2024-07-31"],
      container={
          "skills": [
              {"type": "anthropic", "skill_id": "xlsx", "version": "latest"},
              {"type": "anthropic", "skill_id": "pptx", "version": "latest"}  # Cache miss

### Error Handling

Handle Skill-related errors gracefully:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python theme={null}
  try:
      response = client.beta.messages.create(
          model="claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
          max_tokens=4096,
          betas=["code-execution-2025-08-25", "skills-2025-10-02"],
          container={
              "skills": [
                  {"type": "custom", "skill_id": "skill_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUv", "version": "latest"}
              ]
          },
          messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Process data"}],
          tools=[{"type": "code_execution_20250825", "name": "code_execution"}]
      )
  except anthropic.BadRequestError as e:
      if "skill" in str(e):
          print(f"Skill error: {e}")
          # Handle skill-specific errors
      else:
          raise
  ```

  ```typescript TypeScript theme={null}
  try {
    const response = await client.beta.messages.create({
      model: 'claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929',
      max_tokens: 4096,
      betas: ['code-execution-2025-08-25', 'skills-2025-10-02'],

        ]
      },
      messages: [{role: 'user', content: 'Process data'}],
      tools: [{type: 'code_execution_20250825', name: 'code_execution'}]
    });
  } catch (error) {
